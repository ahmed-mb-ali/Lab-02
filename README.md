Demonstrating the use of: "SharedPerfrences, Optional Menu, DatePicaker, Drawables, Intents"

I have created an application for lease or rent houses.

I have created Ten Activities. A user can select a house, apartments to see it virtual or physical. then the user can click on checkout to pay cash, debit or visa. The user name will be saved in a sharedPerfrences to be displayed in the final page to take the user for purchasing.
